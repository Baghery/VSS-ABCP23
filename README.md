# [VSS from Distributed ZK Proofs and Applications](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/992)

This repository contains the implementation of our Verifiable Secret Sharing scheme, as presented in our paper titled [VSS from Distributed ZK Proofs and Applications](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/992). The paper is publicly available on the [IACR eprint](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/992) archive and was authored by Shahla Atapoor, Karim Baghery, Daniele Cozzo, and Robi Pedersen. The implementations are done by Robi Pedersen and Karim Baghery.

## Overview
Current implementation is done using SageMath and the code includes the implementaiton of following schemes: 
- Shamir Secret Sharing 
- Pedersen Verifiable Secret Sharing 
- Our new Verifiable Secret Sharing 

## Running the Code
**Note: This implementation is intended for academic purposes.**
### Option 1: Online SageMath Terminal
A simple way to run our code is to copy the source code from this repository into the SageMath terminal and push the Enter press! 

### Option 2: Run Online
Alternatively, you can run the code directly in an online SageMath terminal by clicking the following link:
